title: MCP Integration - Model Context Protocol
---

## What is MCP (Model Context Protocol)?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard developed by Anthropic that enables AI assistants to connect with external data sources and tools through a standardized interface. It acts as a bridge between AI models and various systems, allowing models to access real-time data, execute functions, and interact with external services seamlessly.

## Fiscal.ai MCP Server

Fiscal.ai provides a native MCP server that exposes our entire financial data API through the Model Context Protocol. This allows you to build a custom chatbot that can query our financial data API with only a few lines of code.

### How It Works

The Fiscal.ai MCP server implements the MCP specification through Server-Sent Events (SSE). Here's the architecture:

1. **MCP Client** (Claude Desktop, etc.) connects to our MCP endpoint
2. **Authentication** happens via the `x-api-key` header, tied directly to your Fiscal.ai API key
3. **Tool Calls** are routed through our existing REST API infrastructure, respecting the limits and access control of your Fiscal.ai API key
4. **Responses** are formatted according to MCP standards and streamed back

## Available Tools

The MCP server exposes **15 tools** that cover all major aspects of our financial data:

### Company Data

- **`companies_list`** - Get list of all available companies
- **`company_profile`** - Detailed company information and metadata
- **`company_earnings_summary`** - Executive summary of earnings data

### Financial Statements

- **`company_financials_as_reported`** - Raw financial statements as filed with SEC
- **`company_financials_standardized`** - Normalized financial data across companies
- **`standardized_metrics_list`** - Available standardized metrics by industry template

### Financial Analysis

- **`ratios_list`** - All available financial ratios and their definitions
- **`company_ratios`** - Company's calculated financial ratios
- **`company_daily_ratios`** - Time series data for specific ratios

### Market Data

- **`company_shares_outstanding`** - Share count data over time
- **`company_stock_splits`** - Stock split history
- **`company_stock_prices`** - Historical price data (15-minute delay)

### Business Intelligence

- **`company_segments_and_kpis`** - Business segment performance and KPIs

### Document Access

- **`filing_page_image`** - Extract specific pages from SEC filings as images
- **`filing_pdf`** - Download complete SEC filings as PDFs

## Setup Guide

### 1. Obtain API Access

Get your Fiscal.ai API key by following our [Getting Started guide](/guides/getting-started). The same API key works for both REST API and MCP access.

### 2. Configure Your MCP Client

#### For Claude Desktop, and other UI-based MCP Clients

Add this configuration to your `~/.claude/mcp.json`, or any other MCP client configuration file.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fiscal": {
      "url": "https://api.fiscal.ai/mcp/sse",
      "headers": {
        "x-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<Warning>
**Authentication**

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual Fiscal.ai API key. The MCP server validates API keys the same way as our REST API.
</Warning>

### 3. Restart Your MCP Client

After adding the configuration, restart Claude Desktop or your MCP client to load the new server connection.

## Testing Your MCP Connection

You can test your MCP server connection using the official MCP Inspector tool:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector@latest
```

This opens a web-based UI where you can:

- Test all available tools with interactive forms
- Browse company data and financial statements
- Execute queries and view responses in real-time
- Debug connection issues and validate your API key

The inspector supports both SSE and HTTP transport types, making it perfect for testing our Fiscal.ai MCP server.

## Usage Examples

Once connected, you can ask natural language questions about financial data:

**Company Analysis:**

- "What's Apple's current P/E ratio compared to Microsoft?"
- "Show me Tesla's quarterly revenue growth over the last 2 years"
- "Compare the profit margins of Netflix and Disney"

**Financial Statements:**

- "Get Amazon's latest cash flow statement"
- "Show me the balance sheet for NVIDIA as reported in their 10-K"
- "What are Google's standardized income statement metrics?"

**Market Data:**

- "Has Apple had any stock splits recently?"
- "Show me the daily stock price trend for Microsoft this year"
- "What's the current shares outstanding for Tesla?"

**Document Research:**

- "Get page 15 of Tesla's latest 10-K filing as an image"
- "Download the PDF of Apple's most recent earnings report"

## Data Formats

The MCP can query the data exactly the same way as the rest of the API.

### Company Identifiers

All tools use the format: `<EXCHANGE>_<TICKER>`

- Apple: `NASDAQ_AAPL`
- Tesla: `NASDAQ_TSLA`
- Microsoft: `NASDAQ_MSFT`

### Financial Statement Types

- `income-statement` - Revenue, expenses, net income
- `balance-sheet` - Assets, liabilities, equity
- `cash-flow-statement` - Operating, investing, financing cash flows

### Industry Templates

For standardized metrics:

- `standard` - General industry metrics
- `capital-markets` - Banks, investment firms
- `financials` - Financial services
- `insurance` - Insurance companies
- `real-estate` - REITs and real estate
- `utilities` - Utility companies
