## Fiscal.ai API Documentation

Welcome to the Fiscal.ai API documentation. This API provides access to comprehensive financial data for public companies, including financial statements, ratios, stock prices, and corporate filings.

Data for most companies in our coverage is updated within **minutes** of public disclosure.

### API Overview

The Fiscal.ai API offers the following data categories:

- **Company Information**: Company profiles and basic details
- **Financial Statements**: Income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements in both standardized and as-reported formats
- **Financial Ratios**: Comprehensive ratio calculations with daily updates
- **Segments & KPIs**: Business segment data and key performance indicators
- **Stock Data**: Stock prices with 15-minute delay
- **Corporate Actions**: Stock splits and other corporate events
- **Filing Data**: Access to original SEC filings with sourcing capabilities

### Understanding As-Reported vs Standardized Data

**As-Reported Data**: Raw financial data exactly as companies filed it with the SEC
- Company-specific line item names (e.g., "Products", "Services Revenue", "iPhone Sales")  
- Varying formats and structures between companies
- Direct from 10-K, 10-Q filings

**Standardized Data**: Normalized data mapped to common schema for comparison
- Consistent metric names across all companies (e.g., "Total Revenues")
- **Includes the underlying as-reported data** showing the mapping
- Each standardized metric shows which as-reported items were used and how (addition, subtraction)

**Key Relationship**: Standardized data is **not separate** from as-reported data - it's as-reported data **plus the mapping layer**. When you get standardized data, you see both the final standardized number AND the underlying as-reported components that created it.

**Example**: 
- Apple's "Total Revenues" (standardized) = "Products" + "Services" (as-reported)
- Microsoft's "Total Revenues" (standardized) = "Product Revenue" + "Service Revenue" (as-reported)  
- Both map to the same standardized metric for easy comparison
